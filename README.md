## Install
1. [Install the latest version of SMAPI](https://smapi.io).
2. Install Mopsy's Ranch Livin' from the **Files** section of [its Nexus page]().
3. Launch Stardew Valley via SMAPI!

## Configure
1. Load up a save file. If you want your suffix to be "Ranch", you're done!
2. If you want it to be something else, run the command `farm_setsuffix Ranch` in the SMAPI command prompt, where Ranch is something else. Don't make it too long or it'll look dumb in some places.

That's it! Running that command saves it to a config file, so whenever you load up a save, it'll remember which suffix you used for that save! You can find this config file in your Saves folder, and you can also edit it manually!

## Notes
Tested with Stardew Valley 1.3.11-beta and SMAPI 2.6-beta.14.

## Changelog
### 1.0.0
* Initial release; compatible with Stardew Valley 1.3.11-beta and SMAPI 2.6-beta.14.
